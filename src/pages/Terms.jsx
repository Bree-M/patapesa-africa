          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            PataPesa Africa is a non-custodial financial marketplace and does not hold
            funds, issue loans, or act as a financial institution. We connect users
            with verified providers through our platform.

          <h2>2. Non-Custodial Nature</h2>
          <p>
            All transactions occur directly between users and providers using
            PesaDirect™. PataPesa Africa never holds user funds or acts as an
            intermediary for payments.
          </p>
  
          <h2>3. Provider Verification</h2>
          <p>
            We verify providers are licensed and regulated, but users are responsible
            for conducting due diligence before engaging with any provider.
          </p>
  
          <h2>4. Limitation of Liability</h2>
          <p>
            PataPesa Africa is not liable for transactions between users and providers.
            All disputes must be resolved directly with the relevant provider.
